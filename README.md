# CheckNSign

This is the frontend part of the CheckNSign App. 

Imagine DocuSign but with privacy; CheckMate is for DocuSign what DuckDuckGo is for Google. The idea is to allow people to exchange and sign contracts and then immediately dispose of the sensitive data in the server so they can have real privacy. Also, CheckMate makes use of blockchain to guarantee integrity and validity of transactions.
